# 8-project-1

* First Group Project- an API-powered web application that pulls data from multiple sources in a creative way.

* original project: https://thejihongjin.github.io/8-Project-1/

## Problems Experienced and how they were solved:

* Fulfilling new-technology requirement-since we had already used Bootstrap in our project, integrating Materialize was not ideal. Instead, The Onion's Fartscroll.js was added for a hilarious user experience.

* Adding gifs with Quotes about Chuck Norris or Kanye West- since the API main, initial API requests were called through a Switch Statement, a separate, second API request had to be made and added to the respective Case.

## Technical Approach:

* Tasks were divided between the group- One team member built the structure and reconciled the code, the other team member and I researched API results and edited CSS.
